#Notes from 1/28/14

###Need to install:
1. debugger gem for terminal -- Should be located in the Phase 1 gist for reference (explination of debugger gem under Shady's Discussion topic).
2. gitx for terminal so that I can learn git better

###What I want to go back and review:
1. Custom exceptions


##Aha! Moments
1. Big O - How large the output can potentially be. There's also big Theta and Big Omega. These show the best and worst cases.
2. .divmod - ex. x, y = 10.divmod(3) ---> x is the result of division and y is the remainder that's returned. The return is an ordered set [x,y]. In this case x = 3 and y = 1.
3. backreference - ex. /(.)(.)\2{3}/ The first period captures the first example and the second period captures the second character. The two represents the backreference that we're looking at, so the second capture. The three represents how many times we want it to be captured.

##30 Minute Basics Lecture
1. command-control-D -> select all of a certain selection.
2. if/else statements for multiple types of comparisons.
3. case statements are for fanning off of one variable and looking at only that one.
4. One-liner is called a guard clause.
5. in-line if ex. condition ? if_true : if_false
6. redo vs. retry      ------ I don't know what this means looking back on it ----
7. enumerable methods are the best investment

##Git Notes
Follow this order to properly create and update git files: 
1. git clone *https pulled from git repo* -- clone
2. git co -b Branch_Name -- create new branch and checkout in order to work on it.
3. Make whatever edits wanted.
4. git add Branch_Name -- add the new info/changes
5. git commit -m "comments comments what changed" -- add comments about what happened.
6. git push origin Branch_Name -- push the info back to the branch on github.

##Shady's Chat About Debugging
1. exception -> An error, like syntax or usage issue not a logical error.
2. begin/rescue is similar to try/catch.
3. inherit symbol is < 
4. caller will tell you the trace that it took to get to where you placed caller. It prints the call stack. Caller is a method. Can be implemented like: puts caller
5. There's a main object. Methods that aren't defines in a class are placed in this main class object.
6. The debugger gem allows you to inject yourself wherever you would like to be and allows you to return information necessary for debugging. It may have some other useful things?
7. .methods is super useful to see some of the method options for whatever you're looking at.

##Different types of sorts that I learned:
1. Insertion: Insertion looks for the smallest number in the array and moves it to a new array. It then looks for the next smallest number and moves it to the new array, placing it after the first find and repeats this process until the original array is empty and the new array is filled with all of the values.
2. Bubble: Bubble sort basically looks at the first two elements, compares them and switches them if necessary. Then, it moves over one and compares those two and continues through the entire array. It begins again and repeats this process until it can run through the entire thing and not make any changes.
3. Selection: Selection sort bascially begins at the first index and then checks each element in the array until it finds the lowest and swaps those values with eachother. It then moves to the next index and finds the lowest in the remaining array and swaps thsoe. It continues this until it reaches the end of the array - 1.
4. Merge: Merge initially breaks apart all of the values and makes them their own entities. It then groups them in sets of 2 with the lowest value first. After that, it compares a group of two with another group of two and takes the first values off of group, compares them, and places them in order until all of the values are gone. It continues this will all of the pairs of two until there are no more to compare. It then compares two groups of 4, looking at the first number of each and placing them in order into a group of eight. This process continues until all of the elements have been placed in order.
