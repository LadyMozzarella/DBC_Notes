##Aha! Moments
1. The to_s method can't be overwritten to return something other than a string. If something else is put into it, to return and it doesn't understand, it will return the object ID by default.
2.
```
def [] = (index, value) ---> instance method.
  #do soemthing
  true
end
```
Should be called: board.[] = (0, 'a')
Not: board[] = 'a'
Assignment method needs: Can have as many spaces between it, but the return value will be igmored and replaced.
3. Regex -
foo = stuff
regex catpures ->  /(?<var>.)(?<var2>.*) =~ foo
4. Using 1D array in order to create index a mod can be used for columns and a divisor can be used for rows. -> The fourth column can be %4 and get 3, col.
5.
```
arr = [1,2,3]
arr2 = arr
arr2 = [1,2,4]
puts arr # [1,2,4]
```
They're both pointing to the same object. The .dup method needs to be used to create a method copy.
