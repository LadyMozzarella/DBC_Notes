##Aha! Moments
1. When uploading to git you move your files to a staging area prior to pushing your repo. That's the process of adding and pushing and where it goes. Staging phase is your preparing phase.
2. Make commit small, but complete.
3. linked list is basically an object within an object within and object, etc.
4. ||= -----> only assign value if variable has a false truthy value (as in nil or false). It only assigns if it's nil or false.
ex.
```ruby
a = true
a ||= true
b = false
b ||= false
b == 4
```
4. params[:user][:address][:zip] = 94607 is equivalant to
params = { :user => { :address => { :zip => 94607}}}
5. A symbol is a data type, not a variable.
6. Hash with indifferent access is one that doesn't matter the syntax.

##General
1. .ljust (left justify method) is sooo much easier than " %9s " kind of formatting.
2. require pry is another debuffing gem that can be installed.
