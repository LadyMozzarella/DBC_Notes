#Phase 1 Week 1 Day 3 - January 29, 2014

##To Do
Git tutorial from day 2 --> Spend 5+ Hours

##Aha! Moments
1. Merge sort explanation
2. Insert sort explanation
3. benchmark library -> benchmark measure. It will measutre the time that it takes to run through whatever you're in.
4. Big O -> Oh Shit!
5. Big Theta -> The most likely possibility?? (don't know for sure)
6. Big Omega -> Best possible case.
7. Algorithms/Sorting methods have to be considered by space vs. time.
8. Branch has nothing to do with master.

##General
1. array[row][col] for 2d array
2. command + tab (click multiple times to switch apps)
3. Sudoku board is a nondirectional graph. Sample 25 from Part 5 of Week 1 data structure challenges.

##Shadi's Test-Driven Development (OO Intro and Assertions)
1. An object encapsulates attributes and methods.
2. assert (expression)
```ruby
def assert(expression)
	raise unless expression
end
```
Raise an error if expression evaluates to false.
3. Alternate -> 
```ruby
def assert_equal(left, right)
	left == right ? true : "expected #{right} but got #{left}"
end
```
Left is answer wanted, right is what we tested.
